# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud happens when consumers give their credit card number to unfamiliar individuals, when cards are lost or stolen, when mail is diverted from the intended recipient and taken by criminals, or when employees of a business copy the cards or card numbers of a cardholder. We can use this data to get hands-on experience in datamining to find fraud in credit card transactions.
